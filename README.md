# Lambda-Tool

This project allows you to upload your lambda functions to AWS with little configuration.

You will need to install the aws-sdk and the aws-cli. Both will need to be configured with your personal
access keys and your secret keys.

This is a project used as a tutorial.

To find the tutorial search youtube under the name "geeky possum."
